This is the scanner used at http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroVersions.bit

ZeroVersions makes uptodate checks which ZeroNet version is running by the peers.

I use here bash and python. This is by far not optimal, but it works. :-( For now...

I am happy about bugs you find and other suggestions.

--------
How to run this?

1. start the watch monitor first:

	sh ./ start_watch.sh
	
		this collects every 100 seconds the data from ZeroNet's Stats page, via wget
		
		and writes into a file in this format: result_2016_03_25__16_50_20

		(you could also make a cron script instead)

2. and to get the FINAL results, execute:
3. 
	sh ./start_get_RESULT.sh

3. an example output of step 2. looks like this:

sh start_get_RESULT.sh
 
we detect here the time of the result files, so I can determine how long the data was collected:

result_2016_03_25__16_50_20

result_2016_03_26__17_15_24
 
 
result is in   : new9.txt

frequency is in: new9_frequency.txt

peer amount: 443 (from new9.txt)
